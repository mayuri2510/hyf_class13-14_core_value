This repository is yours to keep track of what you've covered so far, to get to know each other, to share helpful resources, to practice collaboration workflows, ... to do everything!

Slack is great for chatting but links and good explanations can easily get lost in message history. Think of this repository as your class' forum and home page.

## Workflows

A short guide to using the issues in this repo.

### Label: `help-wanted`

You can attach this label to any issue or PR that you need help completing. If the code you are blocked on is in another repository, you can create a new issue using the `help-wanted` template to describe your problem and link to your code.

### Label: `question`

Got a question about anything? Go ahead and ask! You can use this label on an existing issue/PR, or create a new issue to discuss your question.

### Check-Ins

Each module you will create a new check-in issue. You will use this issue to keep track of your self-study progress, and to post a check-in each Wednesday including:

- **Progress**: What went well so far this week?
- **Blocked**: What blocked you this week? How did you get past it?
- **Next Steps**: What will you work on for the rest of the week?
- **Tip(s) of the Week**: Did you find a neat trick or a helpful link this week?

### Projects

For each project (individual or group) you will place a new issue on the Class Projects board.

- If you are blocked, add the `help-wanted` label
- When you think you're finished, move your issue into the Ready for Review column
  - If your project is complete, a coach will move it into the Done column
  - Else they will move it to Needs Revision. When you've addressed the feedback you can move it back into Ready for Review

### Roll-Calls

Each Sunday before class your coach will create a new Roll Call issue. Leave a little comment to say hello and let us all know how your week went.

## Typical Week

Throughout the HYF course and your overall career as a programmer, you will _control your own fate_. 35 hours of study is just the bare minimum to get by at HYF, not enough to fully prepare you for your first job.

The more you know and the harder you work, the faster you will find yourself in a career you love.

The more you participate and become part of the HYF community, the more people are going to be willing to help you in return.
