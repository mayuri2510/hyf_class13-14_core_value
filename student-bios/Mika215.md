I am learning coding at the HuckYourFutureBelgium Class-13-14. ğŸ’¥ ğŸ’¥

Here is my favorite quote:

Those who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world are those who do it!

I am hopping that sooner i will be able to master the basics of coding and immediately begin the big projects i have in my mind.
