## Hello!

My name is Alina Marasca. I am a student at [__HackYourFuture Belgium__](https://www.hackyourfuture.net) course.

I have no prior coding experience, except for a few lessons at school in the times of floppy disks.:floppy_disk:
But I like learning and developing new skills and I accept the challenge.:crossed_swords:

If I am not in front of computer digging into code, I might be:

- :lotus_position_woman: doing yoga
- :camera: taking pictures
- :national_park: getting lost in nature
- :finland: learning Finnish
- :sweat_smile: in front of another computer trying to master digital illustration
