Study Plan

<!-- create a study plan for yourself in this module -->
<!-- you can start your list by making checklist from the module's suggested study -->
<!--  one check-box per topic is enough, no need to list each link -->
<!--  check off a topic when you are confident applying the concept in your projects -->
<!-- but don't stop there!  this is your study plan, make it work for you -->

<!--
  copy and fill out this section, once for each week in the module
  each week add a new `week-x` label when your check-in is ready for review
-->

Week X

<!--
  be sure to look through the exercises before starting the project. 
  You don’t need to finish them before the project,
  but starting them will help understand the project. 

  your goal each week is to finish the project
  working on exercises should help you finish the project, not get in the way
  you can always come back to study the exercises latersa
