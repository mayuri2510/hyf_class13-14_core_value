# Hi there, my name is Sheyla

---

I was born in Per√∫ and grew up in Spain. :blush: I graduated with a bachelor in Journalism and Master degree in E-commerce from the Complutense University of Madrid. I'm slightly obsessed with photography, sustainability and **coding**. My mission is to find a new professional path within the UX-UI design field. I'm glad and excited to start my adventure with [HackYourFuture Belgium](https://www.hackyourfuture.net) family.

## My favorite hobbies are

1. Travelling :earth_asia::green_heart::beetle:
2. Eating asian food :ramen:
3. Taking pictures :camera:
4. Yoga and pilates :cactus:
